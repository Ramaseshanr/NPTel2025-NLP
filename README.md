This repository provides a comprehensive collection of resources, including presentations, code samples, and a curated corpus, to support the topics covered in the workshop. The presentations offer structured insights into key concepts, while the sample code demonstrates various techniques discussed during the sessions. By exploring these examples, participants can gain a deeper understanding of the methods and algorithms introduced, reinforcing theoretical knowledge through hands-on application.

Additionally, the corpus spans two distinct domains: budget speeches delivered by Indiaâ€™s Finance Ministers from 1947 to 2023 and a collection of 100+ research papers on COVID-19. These resources are designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice, enhancing the overall learning experience.
